If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t mind a bit of peanut butter and chocolate for breakfast then firstly, we can be friends, and secondly, this peanut butter chocolate chia pudding recipe is for you.

Oh what’s that? You don’t think you like chia pudding? If you’ve tried the watery goop they call chia pudding in the supermarket and decided you hate it then please, please, PLEASE try a homemade one and I promise you will reconsider you’re hatred. Especially if you go and make it peanut butter and chocolate flavoured and top it with chia seed jam, more peanut butter and cacao nibs.

It takes about 10 minutes to whip it up, from getting the ingredients out of the cupboard to washing the dishes – yep, it’s honestly that easy. And if you’re not worried about it looking pretty then you can forget the layers and just mix it all up in one container. A few hours later it’ll be ready to go!

I’ve used coconut milk and Mayvers coconut peanut butter, because I love coconut almost as much as I love peanut butter, but you can use any milk and any nut or seed spread you like. Go crazy! You can also top it with whatever you want. I went with raspberry chia seed jam, more PB and cacao nibs and let’s just say I’d do it again.

Oh, and just between you and me, when I say this recipe makes two servings, I mean two BIG servings. You are welcome.
