    * 3 tbs melted coconut oil

    * 1/2 cup dates, soaked in boiling water for at least 5 minutes


    Raspberry Layer


    * 2 cups raspberries, fresh or frozen (no need to defrost if using frozen)

    * 2/3 cup raw cashews, soaked overnight

    * 1/2 cup desiccated coconut

    * 1/3 - 1/2 cup maple syrup

    * 1tbs chia seeds

    * 1/4 cup maple syrup

    1. Process the almonds, cacao and coconut in your food processor until they
    are a flour-like consistency. Add coconut oil and dates and process. Press
    this mixture into a square pan and put in the freezer to chill while you
    make the next layer.

    2. Process all ingredients for the middle layer except the chia seeds until
    combined. Add chia seeds and pulse once or twice to mix through. Taste and
    add extra maple syrup if desired.

    3. Pour this over the top of the base layer and return to the freezer to set
    before topping with the chocolate layer (approx. 1 hour - plenty of time to
    clean up your food processor, make a cup of tea and start on the next
    layer).

    4. For the chocolate layer, melt coconut butter over a low heat, before
    whisking in the cacao powder. Once smooth, add the maple syrup. Start with a
    quarter cup and add more if you prefer things a little sweeter. Pour this
    layer over the raspberry layer and place it back in the freezer to set
    (approx. 2-3 hours).

    5. Remove from the freezer when firm and slice.

    Store in the freezer and remove about 15 minutes before serving.

    The defrosting time will depend on how big you have cut your slices.

I managed to make this slice one night after work and was so happy to find that I had all the ingredients sitting in my pantry. If you cook raw/vegan foods often this will be a breeze for you. And while I have said to soak your cashews in the recipe, I'll let you in on a secret. It's not 100% necessary. If you have time then it's a good idea, but if you forgot to soak your cashews then there is no reason to throw in the towel! I didn't soak mine and I got nothing but praise for these babies.

While the recipe does require you to clean out the food processor between the base and middle layers, it is pretty simple beyond that. Process, press, freeze, repeat. Then top with a heap of chocolatey goodness.

Now that I have convinced you that this recipe isn't all that hard, despite the 3 layers, I had better let you know just how good it tastes (you know, in case the 'chocolately goodness' didn't get you). The original recipe had a little bit of coconut in the middle layer but I couldn't resist the urge to step that up a notch and add it to the base layer and then top the whole slice with it as well. To be honest, I added so much coconut to this that I contemplated making the title Raw Chocolate Raspberry Coconut Slice. But I decided not toâ€¦ because if you don't like coconut you can just leave it out of the base, reduce it in the middle and leave it off the top.

On the topic of coconut, I might have mentioned my love of coconut butter in a previous post. I resisted the temptation to buy it for so long because it is not exactly cheap. But one day I caved a bought it for a specific recipe and now I'm hooked. It is just a lot creamier than coconut oil which I love, especially when it comes to homemade chocolate. Having said that, if your willpower is stronger than mine and you don't have any coconut butter, then coconut oil will do the trick.
