    * 3 tbs melted coconut oil

    * 1/2 cup dates, soaked in boiling water for at least 5 minutes


    #### Raspberry Layer


    * 2 cups raspberries, fresh or frozen (no need to defrost if using frozen)

    * 2/3 cup raw cashews, soaked overnight

    * 1/2 cup desiccated coconut

    * 1/3 - 1/2 cup maple syrup

    * 1tbs chia seeds


    #### Top Layer

    will vary)

    * 1/4 cup maple syrup

    1. Process the almonds, cacao and coconut in your food processor until they
    are a flour-like consistency. Add coconut oil and dates and process. Press
    this mixture into a square pan and put in the freezer to chill while you
    make the next layer.

    2. Process all ingredients for the middle layer except the chia seeds until
    combined. Add chia seeds and pulse once or twice to mix through. Taste and
    add extra maple syrup if desired.

    3. Pour this over the top of the base layer and return to the freezer to set
    before topping with the chocolate layer (approx. 1 hour - plenty of time to
    clean up your food processor, make a cup of tea and start on the next
    layer).

    4. For the chocolate layer, melt coconut butter over a low heat, before
    whisking in the cacao powder. Once smooth, add the maple syrup. Start with a
    quarter cup and add more if you prefer things a little sweeter. Pour this
    layer over the raspberry layer and place it back in the freezer to set
    (approx. 2-3 hours).

    5. Remove from the freezer when firm and slice.

    Store in the freezer and remove about 15 minutes before serving.

    The defrosting time will depend on how big you have cut your slices.
